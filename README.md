# Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy (M3FrEn)

This repository contains MATLAB code for _Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy (M3FrEn)_. M3FrEn is a novel entropy-based metric for EEG signal analysis that simultaneously incorporates multiscale dynamics, multichannel dependencies, and multi-frequency structure into a unified framework. This metric is introduced in the work:

> _"A Novel Entropy Metric for Unified Analysis of Temporal, Spatial, and Spectral EEG Properties"_  

In this work, we propose **M3FrEn** as a robust and interpretable measure of EEG signal complexity, capturing:
- **Temporal variability** via multiscale coarse-graining and embedding.
- **Spectral diversity** via symbolic permutation analysis across Œ¥, Œ∏, Œ±, Œ≤ bands.
- **Spatial structure** via multichannel embedding.
  
This work extends previous approaches like **mFrEn** [[Niu et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.3390/e26090728)] by including the **delta band**, and introduces **M2FrEn** and **M3FrEn** as the **univariate and multivariate multiscale** generalizations, respectively.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
2. Run `MAIN.m`.

The script generates synthetic EEG signals with controlled noise and structure using a **Mix Model**, and evaluates the three entropy metrics across channels and scales. Results are plotted automatically.
