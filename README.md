# M3FrEn
Repository for Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy

This repository consists of the code of _Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy (M3FrEn)_. M3FrEn is a novel complexity metric for signal analysis that simultaneously incorporates multiscale dynamics, multichannel dependencies, and multi-frequency structure into a unified entropy-based framework. 


# Multi-Frequency Entropy Metrics for EEG Analysis

This repository contains MATLAB implementations of three entropy-based metrics — mFrEn, M2FrEn, and M3FrEn — for analyzing EEG signals across multiple frequency bands. These metrics are introduced in the work:

> _"A Novel Entropy Metric for Unified Analysis of Temporal, Spatial, and Spectral EEG Properties"_  


# Contents

- `MAIN.m` – Main script for testing the metrics on simulated EEG signals.
- `mFrEn.m` – Multi-Frequency Entropy (single-channel, single-scale).
- `M2FrEn.m` – Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy (single-channel).
- `M3FrEn.m` – Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy (multi-channel).
- `Multi.m` – Coarse-graining for single-channel signals.
- `Multivariate_Multi.m` – Coarse-graining for multichannel signals.
- `embd.m` – Delay embedding for single-channel signals.
- `embd_multivariate.m` – Delay embedding for multichannel signals.

# Description

This toolbox provides entropy-based tools to quantify the complexity of EEG signals by incorporating:

- Temporal structure (embedding dimension and delay)
- Spectral decomposition (Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta bands)
- Spatial aspects (multichannel analysis in M3FrEn)

Entropy is computed via symbolic permutation analysis based on maximum distance vectors across frequency bands.

# How to Use

1. Open MATLAB.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Run the `MAIN.m` script.
4. The script will:
   - Simulate EEG-like signals using a mixed sinusoid-noise model.
   - Apply mFrEn, M2FrEn, and M3FrEn.
   - Plot entropy values across channels and scales.

You can modify parameters like signal length, number of channels, noise proportion (`p`), or the number of scales directly in `MAIN.m`.

# EEG Frequency Bands Used

| Band  | Frequency Range |
|-------|------------------|
| Delta | 0.5 – 4 Hz       |
| Theta | 4 – 8 Hz         |
| Alpha | 8 – 13 Hz        |
| Beta  | 13 – 30 Hz       |

# Outputs

- mFrEn: One entropy value per channel.
- M2FrEn: Entropy profile across multiple scales (per channel).
- M3FrEn: Single multiscale entropy curve for all channels combined.

Plots are automatically generated by `MAIN.m`.
