# M3FrEn
Repository for Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy

This repository consists of the code of Multivariate Multiscale Multi-Frequency Entropy (M3FrEn). M3FrEn is a novel complexity metric for signal analysis that simultaneously incorporates multiscale dynamics, multichannel dependencies, and multi-frequency structure into a unified entropy-based framework.
