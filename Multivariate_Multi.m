function M_Data = Multivariate_Multi(Data,S)
%% Multivariate Corse graining process
%  Generate the consecutive coarse-grained time series based on mean
%  Input:   Data: (z Ã— N) matrix, multichannel time series, with z channels and N samples;
%           S: the scale factor.

% Output:
%           M_Data: (z x N/S) matrix, the coarse-grained time series at the
%           scale factor S, with z channels and N/S samples.
